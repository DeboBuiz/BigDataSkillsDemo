# BigDataSkillsDemo
Here I store the codes that I developed in different Big Data technologies. This repository will be helpful in both showcasing my skills and have a reference of codes that can be used for clients. I will keep on adding more and more files as and when I develop them in my personal computer. 

# HTML Files
I have stored DataBricks notebook files in HTML format. In order to view those files, the files would have to be dowloaded in the local system and it has to opened using web browsers.
